This is a repo for trajectory generation mehtod for an underactuated flapping wing robot.
We use the [fmincon](https://www.mathworks.com/help/optim/ug/fmincon.html) to complete the optimization process.

### how to use

- One can directly run Opt, wallOpt, wayPOpt to start the trajectory generation process in Matlab workingspace.
- After corresponding use Plot, wallPlot, wayPPlot to see the corresponding result.
